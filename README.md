This is a Crossmint demo project that you can build using following the quickstart guide here: https://docs.crossmint.com/nft-checkout/embedded/quickstart
Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To skip the walkthrough and get this app running immediately you can clone the repo and run locally. If you want to build it step by step (< 10 min), start with the [quickstart guide](https://docs.crossmint.com/nft-checkout/embedded/quickstart) instead.

```bash
# copy the repo to your local machine
git clone git@github.com:Crossmint/crossmint-embedded-demo.git

# change into the directory
cd crossmint-embedded-demo

# install dependencies / yarn or npm obviously work too xD
pnpm install

# run the app locally and open in your browser
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
